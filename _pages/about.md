I am an incoming postdoctoral researcher with Prof. Deniz G√ºnd√ºz at the [IPC lab](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/information-processing-and-communications-lab) in Imperial College London. I obtained my Ph.D. degree at the Department of Electrical, Computer and Systems Engineering (ECSE), Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute ([RPI](https://www.ecse.rpi.edu/)), advised by [Prof. Ali Tajer](https://www.isg-rpi.com/). Prior to joining RPI, I spent two wonderful years at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, where I was advised by [Prof. Mrityunjoy Chakraborty](http://www.ecdept.iitkgp.ac.in/faculty/MChakraborty/). 

I am broadly interested in problems at the intersection of signal processing, statistics, and machine learning. Much of my research lies in the paradigm of sequential experiental design, where I have looked into various algorithmic aspects of multi-armed bandits. The overarching theme of my research is to investigate inference problems in an adaptive and sample-efficient setting. Phrases that attract my attention include **optimal stopping**, **active learning**, **data-efficient decision making** and **identification** problems in the context of experimental design. I am also keenly interested in algorithmic facets such as **robustness** and **risk-sensitivity**. In another life, I used to work on adaptive filters and digital signal processing.
